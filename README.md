This was a project by Tom Rowson in preparation for interview with Get My Grades

- My process
    I began by making the routes for the 3 pages. Next I designed the navbar, looking at CSS documentation for tips on making it responsive to screen size. I also added graphic changes for hovering over the link.

    I obtained the logo and added styling so that it sat within the navbar.

    Next I designed the layout for the home page, including writing CSS styling for the main image. 

    I then transferred some of the data from the staff page to my code, and used semantic-ui to present this in a card format in a grid. 

- Dependencies I installed
    "semantic-ui-css": "^2.4.1",
    "semantic-ui-react": "^0.86.0"
    "react-router": "^5.0.0",
    "react-router-dom": "^5.0.0",

- What I would do next
    I would like to make more consistent colour theming, including a background colour scheme. I would also like some form of animation in the navbar options. 

    I would also add some interactivity to the staff member cards e.g. a dropdown function to see more info.

    I would like to tidy up some of the alingments. I am not sure why the first staff card sits higher than the rest, so would like to fix this.
